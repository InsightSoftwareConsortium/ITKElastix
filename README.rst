Overview
--------

Provides an `ITK <https://www.itk.org>`_ Python interface to `elastix <http://elastix.isi.uu.nl/>`_, a toolbox for rigid and nonrigid registration of images.

elastix is open source software, based on the well-known `Insight Toolkit
(ITK) <https://discourse.itk.org>`_. The software consists of a collection of algorithms that are commonly
used to solve (medical) image registration problems. The modular design of
elastix allows the user to quickly configure, test, and compare different
registration methods for a specific application.

Installation
------------

Install cross-platform binary Python packages with::

  pip install itk-elastix

Usage
-----

To register two images, traditionally called the fixed image and the moving
image::

  import itk

  # The fixed and moving image can be an itk.Image or a numpy.ndarray
  fixed_image = itk.imread('path/to/fixed_image.mha')
  moving_image = itk.imread('path/to/moving_image.mha')

  registered_image = itk.elastix_registration_method(fixed_image, moving_image)
